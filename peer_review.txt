Peer’s project: Guess a number

What is something you learned by reviewing your peer’s project?



What is something you saw in your peer’s project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

The code is well-documented. I could always do a better job of that.



What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

Since both guessing games are almost the same, the guessing process could be pulled into a function to reduce code duplication.
Also, there is no validation, so if the player types something other than a number, it will crash.



What could have been clearer or better commented?

It is quite clear.



Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

It was all pretty clear.



What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

The purpose of the README.md is to communicate with anyone who is downloading the source code for your project. A programmer would expect some details about not only what the program does, but also the tools or level of knowledge required to understand the code itself.



Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

I appreciate your attention to detail and your original twist on the project.
